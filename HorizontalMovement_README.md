To create movement input code using the A and D keys to move an object left or right, follow these steps:

   1. Create a new C# script called "HorizontalMovement" and open it.

   2. Inside the script, add the code

This script moves the object left or right based on the A and D key input.

   3. In your Unity project, create a placeholder object (e.g., a Cube or Sphere) and attach the "HorizontalMovement" script to it.

   4. In the Inspector, set the movementSpeed property to the desired movement speed for the placeholder object.

Now, when you run the game, the placeholder object will move left or right using the A and D keys.
