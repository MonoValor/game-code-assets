*NOTE USE THIS WHILE ALSO USING COLLISIONWIDGET AT THE SAME TIME TO AVOID CONFUSION LATER*
1. First, create the UI panel/widget (GameObject -> UI -> Panel) you want to slide in and position it outside 
the top of the canvas where you want it to start.

2. Next, with the panel selected, open the Animation window (Window -> Animation -> Animation). Click "Create" 
to create a new animation and save it as "SlideIn" or similar.

3. With the record button enabled in the Animation window, move the panel to where you want it to slide to. Unity 
will automatically create keyframes for the start and end positions.

4. You should see the animation in the Animator window now (Window -> Animation -> Animator), with an "Any State" 
transition to your new SlideIn state.
