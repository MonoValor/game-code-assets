To make the background move slower compared to the movements of the character, you can implement parallax scrolling. 
Here's a step-by-step guide:

   1. Create a new C# script called "ParallaxScrolling" and open it.

   2. Inside the script, add the code
    
This script moves the background at a slower speed compared to the movements of the camera.

   3. In your Unity project, create a background object with a sprite or texture that can be looped seamlessly.

   4. Attach the "ParallaxScrolling" script to the background object.

    In the Inspector, drag and drop the camera object (usually the Main Camera) into the cameraTransform field, and 
    set the parallaxSpeed property to a value between 0 and 1 (0 for no movement, 1 for moving at the same speed as the camera).

Now, when you run the game, the background will move slower compared to the movements of the character, creating a 
parallax effect. Adjust the parallaxSpeed value as needed to achieve the desired effect.
