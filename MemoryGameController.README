1. create a new GameObject in the Unity Editor 
2. add a new script component to it named Card. You can then create a prefab out of 
this GameObject by dragging it from the hierarchy window into the project window.
3. This script assumes that you have a MemoryGameController script in your scene
4. For this script to work, you need to assign the front and back sprites of the card in the Inspector in Unity Editor. 
The Flip() method switches between these two sprites.
5. Remember to save the GameObject with the Card script as a prefab so you can instantiate it dynamically in your game.

This is greately needed for the MemoryFlipMiniGame to work
