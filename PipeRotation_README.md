In Unity, you can create a script that allows you to rotate the pipes 90 degrees each time it is clicked

1. Create a new C# script called "ClickRotate90" and attach it to the object you want to rotate.
2. copy the code

This script rotates the pipes around 90 degrees each time it is clicked.
1. In the Unity Inspector, adjust the rotationAxis property as needed. The rotationAngle is already set to 90 degrees by default.
2. Make sure that the object you want to rotate has a mesh (such as a Cube or Sphere) and a renderer component (such as a Mesh Renderer) for proper visibility.
Now, when you run the scene and click on the object, it will rotate 90 degrees each time you click on it.
