In Unity, you can create a script that allows a set of objects to move along with another set of objects until the player clicks on any 
of the objects in the first set. Here's a sample implementation:

1. Create a new C# script called "InventoryItemsSlide" and attach it to each object in the first set that you want to move along with 
the corresponding objects in the second set.
2. Copy and paste code

This script makes the object follow its corresponding target object until the player clicks on it.

1. In the Unity Inspector, assign the corresponding object from the second set to the targetObject property for each object in the
first set.
2. Make sure that the objects have a mesh (such as a Cube or Sphere) and a renderer component (such as a Mesh Renderer) for proper 
visibility. Also, ensure the objects have a collider (such as a Box Collider or Sphere Collider) to detect mouse input.

Now, when you run the scene, each object in the first set will move along with its corresponding object in the second set until 
the player clicks on the object. After clicking on an object, it will stop following its target object.
